## Known problems
* When a print is aborted it is required to go through `Maintenance/Advanced/Move Material` and proceed until the material comes out of the noozle.

## Adding the material cost
It is possible to add the material cost to [Cura] software so that the user can know the cost of the print.

## Procedures
* Glass removal. Glass does not need to be removed since all cleaning should be performed in place. If you need to remove the glass **do not lift it up or you will bend the clips**. Procedure for restoring bended clips are shown here.

## Maintenance
* Weekly check all 4 rods and rod axle holder
* Weekly clean the filter. Replace cotton if needed
* Weekly erase the files SD card. Keep useful files in a `KEEP` folder.
* Monthly clean the machine and the glass
* Monthly check for missing parts (bowden clip, filter,...) or broken components (printhead,...)
